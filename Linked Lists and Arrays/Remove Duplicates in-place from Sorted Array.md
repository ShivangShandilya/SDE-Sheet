Problem - [Remove Duplicates in-place from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

- Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

If there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of the array should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements.

Note: Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of the array.

- Example 1: 

      Input: arr[1,1,2,2,2,3,3]

      Output: arr[1,2,3,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 3, i.e[1,2,3] and Therefore return 3 after assigning [1,2,3] in the beginning of the array.

- Example 2: 

      Input: arr[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,4,4]

      Output: arr[1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_,_,_]

Explanation: Total number of unique elements are 4, i.e[1,2,3,4] and Therefore return 4 after assigning [1,2,3,4] in the beginning of the array.

Disclaimer: Donâ€™t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

```
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int i=0;
        for(int j=1;j<nums.length;j++){
            if(nums[j]==nums[i])
                continue;
            nums[++i]=nums[j];
        }
        return i+1;
    }
}
```
