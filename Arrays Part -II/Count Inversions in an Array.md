Problem - [Count Inversions in an Array](https://www.codingninjas.com/codestudio/problems/count-inversions_615)

-  Given an array of N integers, count the inversion of the array (using merge-sort).

What is an inversion of an array? Definition: for all i & j < size of array, if i < j then you have to find pair (A[i],A[j]) such that A[j] < A[i].

Example 1:

    Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {1,2,3,4,5}

    Result: 0

Explanation: we have a sorted array and the sorted array 
has 0 inversions as for i < j you will never find a pair 
such that A[j] < A[i]. More clear example: 2 has index 1 
and 5 has index 4 now 1 < 5 but 2 < 5 so this is not an 
inversion.

Example 2:

    Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {5,4,3,2,1}

    Result: 10

Explanation: we have a reverse sorted array and we will 
get the maximum inversions as for i < j we will always 
find a pair such that A[j] < A[i]. 
Example: 5 has index 0 and 3 has index 2 now (5,3) pair 
is inversion as 0 < 2 and 5 > 3 which will satisfy out 
conditions and for reverse sorted array we will get 
maximum inversions and that is (n)*(n-1) / 2.

For above given array there is 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10 inversions.

Example 3:

    Input Format: N = 5, array[] = {5,3,2,1,4}

    Result: 7

Explanation: There are 7 pairs (5,1), (5,3), (5,2), (5,4),
(3,2), (3,1), (2,1) and we have left 2 pairs (2,4) and 
(1,4) as both are not satisfy our condition.

Disclaimer: Donâ€™t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

```
int merge(int arr[],int temp[],int left,int mid,int right)
{
    int inv_count=0;
    int i = left;
    int j = mid;
    int k = left;
    while((i <= mid-1) && (j <= right)){
        if(arr[i] <= arr[j]){
            temp[k++] = arr[i++];
        }
        else
        {
            temp[k++] = arr[j++];
            inv_count = inv_count + (mid - i);
        }
    }

    while(i <= mid - 1)
        temp[k++] = arr[i++];

    while(j <= right)
        temp[k++] = arr[j++];

    for(i = left ; i <= right ; i++)
        arr[i] = temp[i];
    
    return inv_count;
}

int merge_Sort(int arr[],int temp[],int left,int right)
{
    int mid,inv_count = 0;
    if(right > left)
    {
        mid = (left + right)/2;

        inv_count += merge_Sort(arr,temp,left,mid);
        inv_count += merge_Sort(arr,temp,mid+1,right);

        inv_count += merge(arr,temp,left,mid+1,right);
    }
    return inv_count;
}
```
