Problem - [Minimum number of platforms required for a railway](https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-platforms-1587115620/1#)

-  We are given two arrays that represent the arrival and departure times of trains that stop at the platform. We need to find the minimum number of platforms needed at the railway station so that no train has to wait.

- Examples 1:

      Input: N=6, 
      arr[] = {9:00, 9:45, 9:55, 11:00, 15:00, 18:00} 
      dep[] = {9:20, 12:00, 11:30, 11:50, 19:00, 20:00}

      Output:3
      
Explanation: There are at-most three trains at a time. The train at 11:00 arrived but the trains which had arrived at 9:45 and 9:55 have still not departed. So, we need at least three platforms here.

- Solution

Disclaimer: Donâ€™t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

```
import java.util.*;
class TUF {
static int findPlatform(int arr[], int dep[], int n)
    {
        Arrays.sort(arr); 
        Arrays.sort(dep); 
  
        int plat_needed = 1, result = 1; 
        int i = 1, j = 0; 
  
        while (i < n && j < n) { 
        
            if (arr[i] <= dep[j]) { 
                plat_needed++; 
                i++; 
            } 
  
            else if (arr[i] > dep[j]) { 
                plat_needed--; 
                j++; 
            } 
  
            if (plat_needed > result) 
                result = plat_needed; 
        } 
  
        return result; 
    }
 public static void main (String[] args) {
		
		int[] arr ={900,945,955,1100,1500,1800};
		int[] dep={920,1200,1130,1150,1900,2000};
		int n=arr.length;
		int totalCount=findPlatform(arr,dep,n);
		System.out.println("Minimum number of Platforms required "+totalCount);
	}
}
