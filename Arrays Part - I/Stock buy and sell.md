Problem - [Stock Buy and Sell](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

- You are given an array of prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on an ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock. Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

- Example 1:

      Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
      Output: 5
      
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and 
sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Note: That buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 
is not allowed because you must buy before 
you sell.

- Example 2:

      Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
      Output: 0
      
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are 
done and the max profit = 0.

```
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int mi = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] < mi)
                mi = prices[i];
            
            if(prices[i] - mi > profit)
                profit = prices[i] - mi;
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
```
