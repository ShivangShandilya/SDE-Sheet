# SDE-Sheet ( All Important Questions )

This is a repository which holds all the answers for [`Striver's SDE Sheet`](https://takeuforward.org/interviews/strivers-sde-sheet-top-coding-interview-problems/). This repository provides only optimized solutions of all the problems in Java.

## What is SDE Sheet? 

SDE Sheet contains very handily crafted and picked top coding interview questions from different topics of Data Structures & Algorithms. These questions are one of the most asked coding interview questions in coding interviews of companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Media.net, Flipkart, etc,and cover almost all of the concepts related to Data Structure & Algorithms.

### This sheet is solved entirely in Java

## Point to be Noted

This repository was made in order to record my progress and help other students who took upon themselves to solve this sheet. Cheating is not promoted and not even advised as this sheet contains only the optimised solutions of the problems which is not helpful if you dont know the base approach.
For in-depth knowledge of every question do visit Striver's Youtube Channel [`takeUforward`](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward).
